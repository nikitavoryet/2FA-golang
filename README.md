# 2FA-golang

An example of a 2FA (GA) in Go showing the minimum end-to-end flow to support a Google Authenticator. As a request for the user, we receive a secret key for entering by hand or a QR code for scanning, after entering - We check the token and return the result whether it is valid or not.
